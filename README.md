Exploring credit data to create and compare models in predicting loan approval.

## Summary
A CSV containing various financial information from individuals requesting a loan was provided. Two models were created in order to predict whether a loan would be
approved or denied based on the financial data and historical results. The data was standardized and fit to Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models,
and both models proved to be extremely accurate in determining loan approval status. Some additional analysis is provided in the notebook file including a prediction of
which model would be more effective and some follow-up after the models were scored.
